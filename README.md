#Defi Empire, A Simple DeFI Kingdom Clone

Welcome to the DeFi Kingdom Clone project! In this project, we aim to create a decentralized finance (DeFi) game inspired by DeFi Kingdoms. Below are the steps to set up your environment, connect to Metamask, and deploy basic building blocks using Solidity and Remix.

### Setting up your EVM Subnet on Avalanche

To set up your EVM Subnet on Avalanche, please refer to our guide and the Avalanche documentation. Follow the instructions provided to create a custom EVM Subnet tailored to your needs.

### Defining your Native Currency

In this project, we will set up our own native currency to be used as the in-game currency. This currency will facilitate various in-game transactions such as trading, battling, and exploring.

### Connecting to Metamask

To connect your EVM Subnet to Metamask, follow these steps:

1. Install the Metamask browser extension if you haven't already.
2. Click on the Metamask extension icon and select "Custom RPC" from the network dropdown.
3. Enter the details of your custom EVM Subnet as provided in the setup guide.
4. Click "Save" to connect to your custom EVM Subnet.

### Deploying Basic Building Blocks

Using Solidity and Remix, we will deploy the basic building blocks of the game. These include smart contracts for battling, exploring, trading, and more. These contracts will define the game rules, manage liquidity pools, tokens, and other essential functionalities.

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up your EVM Subnet on Avalanche according to the provided guide.
3. Define your native currency and configure it for use in the game.
4. Connect your EVM Subnet to Metamask using the provided instructions.
5. Deploy the basic building blocks of the game using Solidity and Remix.
6. Customize and expand upon the deployed contracts to build out the full functionality of your DeFi Kingdom Clone.
